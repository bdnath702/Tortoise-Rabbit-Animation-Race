This project visualizes the classic fable of the "Tortoise and the Hare" using modern web development tools. It uses HTML, CSS, and WebM video animations to simulate a race between a tortoise and a rabbit. The animation demonstrates motion using CSS keyframes, cubic-bezier timing functions, and absolute positioning to create a fun and interactive visual

The project includes

Two animated characters (a tortoise and a rabbit) moving along a race track.
A finish line with vertical black lines marking the endpoint of the race.
Smooth and realistic motion behavior for both characters: the tortoise progresses steadily, while the rabbit moves fast but slows down, ultimately letting the tortoise win.
Features:
Custom Animations: Smooth motion using CSS keyframes and cubic-bezier timing functions.
Responsive Design: Works seamlessly across devices with adjustable viewport settings.
Lightweight Media: WebM videos ensure efficient loading and playback.
Technologies Used:
HTML5: For structuring the content
CSS3: For styling and animation.
WebM: For lightweight and smooth video playback.
